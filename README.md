# Transparency
## [Roadmap](steps.md)
## Mission
### Infuse digital convenience into spontaneous worship
## Strategy
### Make technology in worship…
#### Accessible
#### Spontaneous
#### Graceful
#### Seamless
### Build in the open

### Primary scenario
#### Low budget, no tech know-how, spontaneous worship with a sprinkle of modern convenience
- Integrate scripture
  - Just reference your scripture; let the computer worry about how it looks (and it will look great!)
- Search for songs/verses in the moment and present at the click of a button
- Easy to create shareable content
  - Focus on your meaning
  - Let the program figure out how to present it
- Easy for everyone to participate
  - Make song requests
  - Assign multiple presenters
  - Allow registration-less access
- Plan for order, also plan for chaos
  - Tweak things on the fly
  - Easy access to escape hatch
  - All operational functions just a click or tap away
  - Collections allow you to gather things in one place for easy access

## Other thoughts
Sometimes when you're gathered together with a casual group or a small house
church, you don't have money to buy "official" songbooks or time/resources to
put together a booklet. I've seen groups like this get by with some searching
on the phone to get lyrics from the internet. (Another solution might be to
memorize them, but… untenable for most) Sometimes we get different versions or
folks struggle to see plus it's so much duplicated effort for everyone to look
at the same time. What if your group had access to a shared database on any
device?

I get it. Many of us are not techno whizzes. Some of us are actually "tech, NO!"

## Open questions
- Are slides a relevant medium here? Would scrolling documents make more sense?
  - Many many churches use projectors, so it seems logical to provide slideshow support
  - Perhaps more flexibility makes sense in the Zoom Era though… unsure if that's here to stay or just a "viral" fad.
